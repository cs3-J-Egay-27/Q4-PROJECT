        <p class="con"> The health of the ocean and marine life <br>
		are so often taken for granted <br>
		and due to our increasing numbers <br>
		and wasteful practices, the ocean <br>
		appears to be as vulnerable to harm <br>
		by human activities as any other <br>
		environmental realmâ€”and maybe even <br>
		more so based on the severity and <br>
		scale of the threats discussed in the article.

        <p class="p1"> Biological diversity in the ocean is much greater than biodiversity <br>
		on landâ€”a staggering concept, considering the abundance and variety of life on <br>
		landâ€”yet much more is known about terrestrial biodiversity. The ocean is not as <br>
		accessible which accounts for part of the problem, but in addition, only in recent <br>
		years has interest in marine biodiversity increased, likely due to the critically <br>
		low populations of several key marine species.
